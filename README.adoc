== Creating and Destroying Objects

* Consider static factory methods instead of constructors
* Consider a builder when faced with many constructor parameters
* Enforce the singleton property with a private constructor or an enum type
``` java
public enum Elvis {
INSTANCE;
public void leaveTheBuilding() { ... }
}
```
